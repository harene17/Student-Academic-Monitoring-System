            <h1>Create Calendar</h1>
            <p style="width: 80%;">Create a calendar for yourself with all your upcoming deadlines, exams, social events, and other time commitments well in advance so you can see what’s coming up.</p>
                <b>Digital calendar options include:</b>
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="https://calendar.google.com/">Google Calendar</a></li>
                    <li><a href="https://flexibits.com/fantastical">Fantastical</a></li>
                </ul>
            <h1>Set Reminders</h1>
            <p style="width: 80%;">After created calendar, give periodic reminders to stay on track such as to complete a study guide in advance or schedule a meeting for a group project.
                The reminders will help to prevent things from slipping through the cracks during particularly hectic days.</p>
            <h1>Prioritize</h1>
                <p style="width: 80%;">Sometimes there is really too much to do with too little time. In these instances, take just a few minutes to evaluate your priorities. Consider which deadlines are most urgent, as well as how much energy you have. </p>

        <div class="im" style="background-image: url('images/notes.jpg');">
            <h1>Keep Your Notes Short</h1>
            <p style="width: 80%;">Keep your notes to a short summary, focusing on what seems to be the most important. You also don’t need to write down stuff you already know. Focus on the information that’s new. Make sure you get that down, and don’t sweat the rest.</p>
            <h1>Use Abbreviations</h1>
            <p style="width: 80%;">Abbreviations are everywhere and for good reason. They save time and can even work as memory aids. Whether you’re typing or writing by hand, you simply don’t need to write out everything.</p>
            <h1>Use Visual Elements</h1>
            <p style="width: 80%;">Taking notes tends to be a pretty text-based affair. But with a little creativity and imagination, you can enhance your notes with visual elements. Some aspects of learning are far easier to sketch in a diagram or illustration form than they are to write out verbatim.</p>

            <h1>Exercise</h1>
            <p style="width: 80%;">Regular exercise can help relieve stress in many ways. There is breathing centred exercise like yoga and Pilates, which is good for grounding and breathing management. Aerobic exercise can equally manage stress hormones, release tension and increase endorphin levels creating a 'feel good' vibe.</p>
            <h1>Talking to someone</h1>
            <p style="width: 80%;">Isolation can have an extremely negative impact on your happiness. Accepting that you need help and talking to someone is often the first step to feeling better.Speak to your friends and family - they know you best and care about you the most.</p>
            <h1>Getting enough sleep</h1>
            <p style="width: 80%;">Try to wake up and go to sleep at the same time each day. Seven to eight hours of sleep is recommended. This might not be realistic every night of the week but aim towards this goal more often than not.
